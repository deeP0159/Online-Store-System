Simple Order Management System (C++)

üìã Description

This is a simple C++ application that simulates a basic order management system. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, encapsulation, and STL containers (map, vector, pair). The program allows you to:

Manage a catalog of products.
Create and display customer orders.
Calculate the total bill based on product prices and quantities.
Update and display stock levels after processing an order.
üõ†Ô∏è Features

Product Class: Stores product information like ID, name, category, and price.
Order Class: Stores order details including customer ID, order date, and a list of purchased products.
Stock Management: Keeps track of product inventory and updates stock levels after each order.
Total Calculation: Calculates the total bill amount based on ordered items and their quantities.
Formatted Output: Displays a neatly formatted product catalog, order summary, and stock status.
